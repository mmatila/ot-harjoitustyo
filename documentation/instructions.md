Type **1** and press _enter_ to log into an existing account. Application asks for credentials. Type in your username and password.  
Type **2** and press _enter_ to create a new account. Application asks for personal information. After typing in all information, account gets created.

## Using the main features

After logging in to an account, the view is a little different:

These commands follow the same pattern as logging in or creating a new account. Detailed instructions will be added later
