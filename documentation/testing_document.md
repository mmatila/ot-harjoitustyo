# Testing document

## Services and DAOs

All Service and DAO classes have been tested using Junit. The tests are separated into four different classes corresponding to what they test
- DatabaseTest
- UserTest
- CategoryTest
- ExpenseTest  

## Jacoco

Both instruction/line coverage and branch coverage in the application are nearly 90%. UI has been left out from this due to it not having too much application logic.

Jacoco report can be generated by typing the command ```mvn test jacoco:report``` in the root folder

## Malfunctions in the program

- When user is deleted, the application continues running and for example adding an expense right after can cause a crash
- Some inputs on certain fields may cause a crash to occur
